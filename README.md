# Rainbow-Canvas-Drawing
Welcome to the **Rainbow Canvas Drawing** project! This project uses the HTML5 Canvas element and JavaScript to create a colorful drawing application. As you draw on the canvas, the line color changes through the hues of the rainbow, and the line width oscillates between thick and thin.
